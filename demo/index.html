			<h1>The Long Tail</h1>
			
			<p><em>By: Chris Anderson</em></p>
			
			<p><small><span id="eta"></span> (<span id="words"></span> words)</small></p>
	
			<p>In 1988, a British mountain climber named Joe Simpson wrote a book called Touching the Void, a harrowing account of near death in the 
			Peruvian Andes. It got good reviews but, only a modest success, it was soon forgotten. Then, a decade later, a strange thing happened. Jon Krakauer 
			wrote Into Thin Air, another book about a mountain-climbing tragedy, which became a publishing sensation. Suddenly Touching the Void started to sell again.</p>

			<p>Random House rushed out a new edition to keep up with demand. Booksellers began to promote it next to their Into Thin Air displays, and sales rose further. A revised paperback 
			edition, which came out in January, spent 14 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. That same month, IFC Films released a docudrama of the story to critical acclaim. Now 
			Touching the Void outsells Into Thin Air more than two to one.</p>

			<p>What happened? In short, Amazon.com recommendations. The online bookseller's software noted patterns in buying behavior and suggested that readers who liked 
			Into Thin Air would also like Touching the Void. People took the suggestion, agreed wholeheartedly, wrote rhapsodic reviews. More sales, more algorithm-fueled recommendations, 
			and the positive feedback loop kicked in.</p>
			
			<p>Particularly notable is that when Krakauer's book hit shelves, Simpson's was nearly out of print. A few years ago, readers of Krakauer would never even have learned about 
			Simpson's book - and if they had, they wouldn't have been able to find it. Amazon changed that. It created the Touching the Void phenomenon by combining infinite shelf space 
			with real-time information about buying trends and public opinion. The result: rising demand for an obscure book.</p>
